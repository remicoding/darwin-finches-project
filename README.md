# Darwin Finches Project

The goal of this project is to analyze 40 years of data collected by Peter and Rosemary Grant on the Galapagos island of Daphne Major published in their book [40 Years of Evolution: Darwin's Finches on Daphne Major Island](https://press.princeton.edu/books/hardcover/9780691160467/40-years-of-evolution).

The data is about Darwin's finches specifically the _Geospiza Fortis_ (fortis) and the _Geospiza Scandens_ (scandens) species. The project uses beak length and depth measurement to highlight evolutionary traits in these species.

The skills displayed in this project include:

- Importing and Cleaning Data
- Exploratory Data Analysis
- statistical inference
- Bootstrap Analysis
- Parameter estimatation
- Hypothesis testing
